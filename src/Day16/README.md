## Number Base Conversion Calculator

Develop a number base conversion calculator using the STL streams library.

- Support addition operator (support for parenthesis is not required).
- Support addition of two operands at once in a single expression.
- All results are displayed as decimal.
- Support conversion them to hex or binary using hex and bin functions.
- Right justify all numbers in a 20 column width.
- If user enters an invalid number (eg. 0xg4f1) then display error "Invalid Number" and show prompt.
- Entering "quit" or "exit" should exit the calculator.

Your command line tool should look like this, with a prompt >.

```
prompt > 0x3839
prompt > 14393
prompt > 0x1515 + 8675
prompt > 14072
prompt > hex 14072
prompt > 0x36f8
prompt > bin 0x36f8
prompt > 0b11011011111000
