## Using Lambda with N-body problem

Simulate the N-body problem in 2 dimensions using several lambda functions.
Make sure all your lambda functions have appropriate capture, parameter, mutable,
return value, body and exception clauses.

Consider the following constants:

```
/* N bodies */
int N = 5; // this will be varied in loop (read below).
/* Gravitational constant */
double G = 6.673e-11;
/* timestep */
double timestep = 0.001;  // experiment with this!
/* small mass */
double initial_mass = 1.0; // experiment with this!
/* num timesteps */
double k = 100; // you can experiment with this! it can be fairly large.
```

Your single body in N-body will look like this:

```
typedef struct body {
    int ind; // index of body
    double mass;
    R position;
    V velocity;
    F *forceVector; // computed {f-i1,fi2...fiN}
    F totalForce; // computed
    A acceleration;  // computed from f = ma
};
```

The magnitude of gravitation force between two objects can be described as

You need to create a single-threaded C++ algorithm to compute force exerted on each body
with respect to other N-1 bodies at each (of k) timesteps. As the bodies collide you will need to
update the force, acceleration, velocity and position at each time step.

For example the force on one body due to another body can be computed as:

Make sure you set the initial position, velocity, acceleration, mass, and force vectors
of a body before you begin the iteration timesteps. Mass of each body will be constant.

Use some lambda equations to:

- Update the force exerted on a body
- Update the acceleration on a body
- Update velocity of a body
- Update position of a body
- Compute distance between bodies (x, y) space

There will be more lambda functions you will write besides above.

You already know how to compute Force for each body using the gravitional equation above
with respect to each of the other N-1 bodies. Where m1 is the mass of this body, and m2 is the
mass of the other bodies from the N-1 bodies. So you will need a for loop to update the
force for each of the N bodies at each timestep.

And from Newton's law, write a lambda for following too:

```
F = m * a
```

Since you know the mass, you can compute the acceleration of each body.

Now that you know the acceleration of each body, the velocity and position of a body at 
ith timestep can be computed as:

```
New Velocity = Current Velocity + timestep*acceleration
```

```
New Position = Current Position + timestep*velocity
```

So you will need additional loop to compute the velocity and position of each body above
at each time step.

Once you compute the force exerted on each body from each of the other N-1 bodies, you will
need to compute the total force exerted on each body by summing the force from each of the N-1
bodies, and you will need to update the total force this way for each of the N bodies in each
time step. This summation also should use a lambda function.

Assuming you run this test for duration D, and with k timesteps for N bodies, you should write
a final lambda function that computes the number of interactions per second using the following
formula:

```
Interactions/sec = k * N * N / D
```

You should run the above test by varying the number of bodies (N):

```
    int numBodies[] = {10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000};
```

So you can then compute interactions per sec lambda for each value of N in above array.

Optionally print a graph with X axis (N) and Y axis (interactions/sec). If you cannot plot a 
graph using matplotlib or something similar, save the data as a JSON file with two elements per
record. First element should be value of N, and second element should be interactions/sec.
