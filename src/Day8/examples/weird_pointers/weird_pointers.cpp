int main(void) {
    //The following should work:
    int* myptr;
    //The following should also work:
    int** myptr1; // called double pointers
    //There is no known limit:
    int********** myptr2; // this also works, but may not be common
    //This allows us however to build multi-dimensional arrays which we will learn later.
