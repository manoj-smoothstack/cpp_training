# Assignments

## 1. CopyAssignable

Build a test for CopyAssignable considering different possibilities, and explain
the rationale for why each case is CopyAssignable or not. You can look at MoveAssignable,
CopyConstructible and MoveConstructible as a reference as based in our presentation.
Your code must compile, run successfully and all the tests need to succeed. Make sure you
have at least 5 class asserts in your test.

## 2. Polymorphism with Shapes

Consider the Shapes assignment from Day 13 and improvise it to work with virtual methods.
So for instance if you compute area() of a Shape, it calls a different method depending upon
if the Shape was a Quadrilateral or a Rectangle. You must write tests that demonstrate that
calls to virtual methods and verify that the correct virtual methods were called using asserts.
