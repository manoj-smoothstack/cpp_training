# Assignments

## Writing a User Exception
Write a function to compare two floats only if they are exactly representable as integer.
So 6.0 is representable as int 6. And 5.1 is not. If they are not exactly representable
you must throw a user defined exception.

## Enhancements to above function

Demonstrate how your function has no tolerance when exceptions are thrown. This should lead
to std::terminate().
