# Assignments

## Shapes

- Consider Polygon is-a 2-D shape (Shape2D).
- And Triangle and Quadrilateral is-a Polygon.
- Trapezoid, Parallelogram is-a Quadrilateral.
- Rhombus is-a Parallelogram.
- Rectangle is-a Parallelogram. 
- Square is-a Rhombus. 
- A Polygon consists of Line(s) or Point(s) (or vertices). 
- And Line is represented by Point(s). A MultiLine consists of Line(s) or Point(s).
- An Ellipse is a 2-D shape. A Circle is-a Ellipse.

Implement all above mentioned shapes as an inheritance/composition class hierarchy 
and include important methods such as 

- area, 
- perimeter, 
- diameter, 
- circumference, 
- distance.

Distance is implemented as distance between two points.

## Special functions

Implement Copy/Move constructors and also Copy/Move assignment operators and demonstrate how you
can use them to copy shapes or construct composite shapes from other shapes.
