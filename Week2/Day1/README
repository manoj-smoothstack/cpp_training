Assignments

1. Write a program that takes as input a fraction, and prints the internally stored approximate floating point number along with J and N where:

Approx ~= J/2**N

So for instance if the user enters the number 0.125, your program responds with:

J = 450828337098296, N = 55
0.125129999999999963478103381930850446224212646484375
