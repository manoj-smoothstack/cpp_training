## 1. Matrix Multiplication

Given two matrices A (mxn) and B (nxp), write logic that computes the product of the two matrices. The matrix element is an int.

C = A x B

Where C is an mxp matrix.

A. Generate input data for A and B.
B. Validate A and B for dimensionality.
C. If valid, then perform the product of AxB and generate C.
D. Print out the three matrices in and row-col order on a terminal.
