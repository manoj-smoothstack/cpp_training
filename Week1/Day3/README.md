Assignments

1. Write a program that creates an array and converts it into a vector.

Allocate an array of 3 floats.
Initialize the array.
Create a vector.
Copy the elements of the array to the vector.
Print out the vector elements on a single line and then an EOL at the end.
Verify your result with the original array.

2. How would you store elements of dissimilar type in an array? Write a program to demonstrate 
that you can store int and float in the same array without using struct, or any class type.

3. In the above example, once you have created the "mixed" array, is it possible to recognize the type
of each element automatically? If so, or if not, why? Show with a code example.
