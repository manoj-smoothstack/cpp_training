Assignments

1. Exercise: Which of the following expressions will fail at runtime? Why? Why not?
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>

using namespace std;

int main(void) {
    assert(3 == 3.0);
    x = 3.1;
    assert(x == 3.1);
    assert(3.1 == 3.1);
    assert(true == 1.0);
    assert('a' == 97);
    int* p = 0;
    assert(NULL == p);
    assert(NULL == 0);
}


2. Exercise: Generate a truth table for cast operators, when arithmetic operations are performed between two variables. For example int + float gives a float. Consider the types: int, float, char, bool

3. Exercise: List the binary, unary and ternary operators with examples

4. Exercise: Will below program work with no errors? Why?
#include <cassert>
  
int main(void) {
    int x = 4;
    int y = x+++2;

    assert(y == 6);
    assert(x == 5);
}

What is the order of precedence of operators above when y is initialized to x+++2?

5. Implement the truth table for AND, OR and NOT operators.
