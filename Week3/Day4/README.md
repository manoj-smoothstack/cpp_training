## 1. CopyAssignable

Build a test for CopyAssignable considering different possibilities, and explain
the rationale for why each case is CopyAssignable or not. You can look at MoveAssignable,
CopyConstructible and MoveConstructible as a reference as based in our presentation.
Your code must compile, run successfully and all the tests need to succeed. Make sure you
have at least 5 class asserts in your test.
